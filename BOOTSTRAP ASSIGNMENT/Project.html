        <h2>Abstract</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="paradiv">
        <p>
            The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incorporate transparently and seamlessly a
            large number of different and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to
            selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of digital services. Building a
            general architecture for the IoT is hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely
            large variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may be involved in such a
            system. In this paper, we focus specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite
            a broad category, is characterized by their specific application domain. Urban IoTs, in fact,
            are designed to support the Smart City vision, which aims at exploiting the most advanced
            communication technologies to support added-value services for the administration of the city
            and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive survey of the enabling
            technologies, protocols, and architecture for an urban IoT.

            A smart city is an urban area that uses different types of electronic Internet of things
            (IoT) sensors to collect data and then use these data to manage assets and resources
            efficiently.</p>
        <p>In this Project we are going to discuss about how we can built a smart city by considering the following
            assets.</p>
        <p>Temparature and Humidity calculation by using DHT11 Sensor.</p>
        <p>Light Intensity Measurement</p>
        <p> Gas concentration Measurement</p>

    </div>

    <div class="paradiv">
        <h1>Temperature and Humidity Caluculating by Using DTH!! sensor </h1>
        <p>The DHT11 is a basic, low-cost digital temperature

            and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity

            sensor and a thermistor to measure the

            surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the

            data pin (no analog input pins needed).

            Its fairly simple to use, but requires careful timing to

            grab data. The only real downside of this sensor you can
            only get once for every two seconds.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paradiv">
        <h1>Work Flow of DTH!! Sensor</h1>
        <p>Once the sensor is powered up, it takes up to 2s to become stable.

            In this period, the sensor tests the environment temperature and humidity,

            and records relative data. When finished, it enters sleep mode automatically.

            The communication starts, when the master (MCU) sends out a start signal. With

            this, the sensor wakes up from the sleep mode, switches to the High-speed mode

            and sends a response signal.

            Following that it outputs a string of 40 bits data consisting of relative temperature

            and humidity values. Once finished, the sensor switches back to the sleep mode

            automatically, waiting for next communication.

            The corresponding timing diagram is shown as below.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paradiv">
        <h1>Light Intensity Measurement</h1>
        <p>Light Dependent Resistance (LDR) Sensor.

            A Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) is also called a photoresistor or

            a cadmium sulfide (CdS) cell. It is also called a photoconductor. It is

            basically a photocell that works on the principle of photoconductivity.

            The passive component is basically a resistor whose resistance value

            decreases when the intensity of light decreases. This device is mostly used

            in light varying sensor circuit, and light and dark activated switching circuits.

            Some of its applications include camera light meters, street lights, clock radios,

            light beam alarms, reflective smoke alarms, and outdoor clocks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paradiv">
        <h1>Concentration Measurement</h1>
        <p>
            For Measuring of Gas concentration we will use Gas Sensor.

            A GAS sensor or a GAS Detector is a type of chemical sensor

            which detects/measures the concentration of gas in its vicinity.

            Gas sensor interacts with a gas to measure in concentration.

            They are used in various industries ranging from medicine to aerospace.

            Various technologies are used to measure Gas concentration such as

            semiconductors, oxidation, catalytic, infrared, etc.</p>

    <div class="paradiv2">
        <h1>MQ2 Gas Sensor</h1>
        <p>
            MQ2 GAS Sensor is a very easy to use and very handy,
            suitable for sensing smoke, Hydrogen, LPG, CO, alcohol, Smoke,
            Propane concentration in the air. MQ2 gas Sensor can detect gas
            concentrations anywhere from 200 to 10000ppm. MQ2 sensor is very sensitive to
            Propane, Hydrogen, methane and LPG.</p>

        <p> MQ series of gas sensors use a small heater inside with an electro-chemical sensor.
            They are sensitive for a range of gasses and are used indoors at room temperature.</p>

        <p> The sensitive material of MQ2 Gas sensor is SnO2,
            which has lower conductivity in clean air. When the target gas exist, the sensor’s
            conductivity is higher along with the gas concentration rising. MQ2
            sensor could be used to detect different
            combustible gases especially Methane. It is very low cost and suitable for different
            application. This sensor can be used to make wireless Gas leak detector in home security
            system.</p>

        <h1>Smart Parking By using IR sensor</h1>
        <p>
            Generally in the parking area , slots for parking the vehicles are limited . If
            the slots are full then we can control the other vehicles to enter into the parking
            area.With the help of IR sensor we can control it...
        </p>

        <p> An infrared sensor is an electronic device, that emits in order to sense some
            aspects of the surroundings. An IR sensor can measure the heat of an object as well
            as detects the motion. Usually in the infrared spectrum, all the objects radiate some
            form of thermal radiations. These types of radiations are invisible to our eyes, that
            can be detected by an infrared sensor.The emitter is simply an IR LED (Light
            Emitting Diode) and the detector is simply an IR photodiode which is sensitive to IR
            light of the same wavelength as that emitted by the IR LED. When IR light falls on
            the photodiode, The resistances and these output voltages, change in proportion to
            the magnitude of the IR light received

        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>
            When the harsware connections are finished ,we need to gothrough the Arduino
            IDE where we can upload our code into it.

            <p> We can analyse the output through four ways :</p>

            <p> 1. Output in Arduino output console.</p>

            <p> 2. By using GSM module we can get the notification messages about the .

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>

        <p>
            In this project, we analyzed the solutions currently available for the
            implementation of urban IoTs. The discussed technologies are close to being
            standardized, and industry players are already active in the production of devices
            that take advantage of these technologies to enable the applications of interest. In
            fact, while the range of design options for IoT systems is rather wide, the set of open
            and standardized protocols is signiﬁcantly smaller. The enabling technologies,
            furthermore, have reached a level of maturity that allows for the practical realization
            of IoT solutions and services, starting from ﬁeld trials that will hopefully help clear
            the uncertainty that still prevents a massive adoption of the IoT paradigm.
