							Difference Between TRUNCATE, DELETE And DROP In SQL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



1)TRUNCATE
-----------
 
	TRUNCATE SQL query removes all rows from a table, without logging the individual row deletions. TRUNCATE is faster than the DELETE query.
 
	syntax;-TRUNCATE TABLE TABLE_NAME;  
 
	1)TRUNCATE is a DDL command

	2)TRUNCATE is executed using a table lock and the whole table is locked to remove all records.

	3)We cannot use the WHERE clause with TRUNCATE.
	
	4)TRUNCATE removes all rows from a table.

	5)Truncate uses less transaction space than the Delete statement.

	6)Truncate cannot be used with indexed views.

	7)TRUNCATE is faster than DELETE.


2)DELETE
---------
 
SQL DELETE query deletes all records from a database table. To execute a DELETE query, delete permissions are required on the target table. If you need to use a WHERE clause in a DELETE, select permissions are required as well.
 

	SYNTAX:-DELETE FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE CONDITION;  

 
	1)DELETE is a DML command.

	2)DELETE is executed using a row lock, each row in the table is locked for deletion.

	3)We can use where clause with DELETE to filter & delete specific records.

	4)The DELETE command is used to remove rows from a table based on WHERE condition.

	5)Identity of column keep DELETE retains the identity.

	6)To use Delete you need DELETE permission on the table.

	7)Delete uses more transaction space than the Truncate statement.

	8)The delete can be used with indexed views.


3)DROP
-------

	SYNTAX:-DROP TABLE TABLE_NAME ;  

	1)The DROP command removes a table from the database.

	2)All the tables' rows, indexes, and privileges will also be removed.

	3)DROP and TRUNCATE are DDL commands, whereas DELETE is a DML command.

	4)DELETE operations can be rolled back (undone), while DROP and TRUNCATE operations cannot be rolled back
